Choacury, (pronounced as coch-curry or /kʰɔx-ˈkʌr.i/), is a custom-built OS written in C and Assembly. Choacury is currently in a very **Pre-Alpha** stage, meaning some stuff isn't complete yet...

If you want to help out on the project, feel free to contribute to the project! (We have a Trello board but you will need to ask for access). You can also modify Choacury to your liking if you want to make your own OS! You can also join the [development server](https://discord.gg/qhgDWrzCvg) if you would like to.

# Getting started
Currently, Choacury only works best with virtual machines. However, you *can* use real hardware if you want, just there might be some issues that will be fixed down the line.

To get started with ChoacuryOS, please [read our documentation](/getting-started.md).
