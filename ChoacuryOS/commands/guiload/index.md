# `guiload` command
{: .warning }
> The `guiload` will eventually be replaced with `lnde-init` in later builds (for launching into the main LNDE desktop), and `graphinit` for launching into the upcoming Graphical Session Manager. Later builds will have `guiload` be used for testing non-text mode graphics (akin to a standard display server test)

The `guiload` command loads into a graphical shell.
