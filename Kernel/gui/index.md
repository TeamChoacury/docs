# GUI - Graphical User Interface

ChoacuryOS comes with some basic built-in features for a graphical interface, such as:

- A fallback WM (**W**indow **M**anager)
  - This will be replaced with a custom one when using Grampian (The default window manager)
  - This is built as a fallback so lacks many features like customisation
